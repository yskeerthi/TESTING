### ‚úÖ What is **Testing**?

**Testing** is the process of **checking if something works correctly**. In software development, **testing** refers to checking a software application or system to ensure that it behaves as expected and **has no bugs or issues**.

---

### üß† Why is Testing Important?

* To **find bugs** before the user does.
* To make sure the software **meets requirements**.
* To ensure the app is **secure, reliable, and performs well**.
* To save time and money by **catching problems early**.

---

### üß™ Types of Software Testing

| Category               | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manual Testing**     | Performed by humans, clicking and checking behavior.                      |
| **Automation Testing** | Uses scripts and tools (like Selenium, JUnit) to run tests automatically. |

---

### üîç Common Levels of Testing

1. **Unit Testing**

   * Tests individual functions or components.
   * Example: Check if a `login()` function returns true for valid credentials.

2. **Integration Testing**

   * Tests how different modules work together.
   * Example: Test how the login page works with the database.

3. **System Testing**

   * Tests the complete system as a whole.
   * Example: Testing the full web application in a browser.

4. **Acceptance Testing**

   * Verifies if the software meets user/business requirements.
   * Often done by clients or QA before release.

### üß∞ Tools Used in Testing

| Type         | Examples                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Unit Testing | JUnit, NUnit, Google Test |
| UI Testing   | Selenium, Cypress         |
| API Testing  | Postman, REST Assured     |
| Load Testing | JMeter, Locust            |
| CI/CD Tools  | Jenkins, GitHub Actions   |

### üí° Real-Life Example

Imagine you're building a **food delivery app**:

* **Unit Test:** Check if the "Add to Cart" button adds the right item.
* **Integration Test:** See if the app correctly communicates with the payment gateway.
* **System Test:** Try placing a full order from start to end.
* **Acceptance Test:** Ensure the app satisfies user expectations.

---

### 1. **What is Functional Testing in Manual testing?**

Functional testing in manual testing is the process of verifying that the software functions according to the specified requirements. It involves checking user interfaces, APIs, databases, security, and other functional aspects of the application **without using any automation tools**. Testers manually execute test cases to ensure each function behaves as expected.

**Example:** Verifying a login feature works correctly with valid and invalid credentials.

| Aspect             | Black Box Testing                          | White Box Testing                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Knowledge required | No knowledge of internal code              | Requires understanding of code logic     |
| Focus              | Functionality of the application           | Internal structure, logic, and flow      |
| Performed by       | Testers                                    | Developers or white-box testers          |
| Testing method     | Based on inputs and expected outputs       | Based on code paths, loops, conditions   |
| Example            | Checking if login works with correct input | Checking if all code branches are tested |

---

### 3. **How do you ensure the quality of software through Functional Testing?**

To ensure quality through functional testing:

* **Create detailed test cases** based on requirements.
* **Validate each function** against expected behavior.
* **Perform both positive and negative testing.**
* **Log and track bugs** to resolution.
* **Retest after fixes (regression testing)** to ensure stability.
* **Use requirement traceability matrix (RTM)** to ensure all requirements are tested.

This process helps catch functional issues early and ensures the software meets user expectations.
